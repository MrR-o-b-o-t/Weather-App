## Summary

I am continuing to improve my JavaScript skills and ability to work with API's. This app is a simple forecast application that pulls information based
on your current location. That information is then displayed to the UI with some simple HTML and CSS and modified with vanilla JS. 

My first attempt at working with an API was a Pomodoro Timer that I built (Check it out on my GitHub!). I decided to pull inspirational quotes and 
display them after every completion of the timer. The Pomodoro and this weather forecast application have been great at getting over the initial 
fear of working with API's. I am not sure about you, but API's seemed intimidating at first. While I am by no means an expert at this point I am
much more comfortable and looking forward to building more complex projects that leverage API's soon! Keep an eye out for them (and the weather with
this great app ;) soon!
